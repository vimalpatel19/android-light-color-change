# LIFX Light Color Change - Andriod App
This POC application was created as a learning experience to develop a simple Android app while incorporating [LIFX light bulbs](https://www.lifx.com/).

<br />

## Objective
The app should evaluate the picture currently displayed in the app, analyze the picture to pick out the 4 predominant colors in it, and update each of the 4 light bulbs with those colors.
